              <p>I’ve always had an interest in science and technology. As I grew older I discovered the magic of computing and electronics. 
                  I’ve always been interested in how electronic devices were built and functioned. 
                  Shortly afterward I started learning about coding and became obsessed with how computers can enrich our lives. 
                  I was amazed that new experiences could be created simpy by writing code into an editor. 
                  I started creating websites for friends and family and developing my own personal projects. 
                  As an adult working in the tech industry I began learning more about how the science of data could be used to develop models
                   that can deliver insights into how people use technology in their everyday lives and how that technology can be iterated and 
                   improved upon using data.</p>
                    
              <p>My specialties include front end development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                  For backend development I specialize in Python, PostgreSQL, and mySQL. 
                  I primarily work with numPy, pandas, Tableau, and R for data analysis.</p>
